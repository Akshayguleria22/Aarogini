## 📊 How AI "Training" Works

The chatbot is trained through:

1. **System Prompt** - Defines personality, knowledge areas, and guidelines
2. **User Context** - Injects your health data before each response
3. **Conversation History** - Remembers last 10 messages for context
4. **OpenAI Training** - GPT model already trained on vast medical knowledge

**No custom fine-tuning needed!** The system prompt + context injection creates a specialized health assistant.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"
- Add real OpenAI key to `backend/.env`
- Restart backend server
- Check key format: starts with `sk-`

### "Rate limit exceeded"  
- OpenAI has usage limits
- Wait a few moments
- Check your OpenAI account quota

### No personalized responses
- Log in to the platform first
- Add some health data (period tracker, journal)
- Ensure backend can access MongoDB

### Backend not connecting
- Check MongoDB connection in backend terminal
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`
- Whitelist your IP in MongoDB Atlas
